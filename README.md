#### Frontend Developer

Since my school years I have been interested in programming. When choosing a profession, I considered going in this direction, but it turned out differently. 
A few years ago I desided to change my life and become a programmer. Now I am moving in the direction I dreamed of. 
I started my journey with Python, took a course on Deep Learning and then got to know web development. And I understood that I found my direction. 
Now my aspirations and desires are aimed at becoming a professional frontend developer.
